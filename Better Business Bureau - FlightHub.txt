Flight Hub is ********** in my opinion as my Total flight to South Africa Via Toronto $2582.16, cancelation insurance was $282.75 which i purchased was included in my total cost. Canceling refund I received was $1847.37. total loss $1143.93 with insurance. I had to spend hours to not lose my whole amount paid as I was denied chance my flight, as well to cancel my flight with the insurance I purchased. Fight hub blamed ********* *** and I could not get ahold of *** ******** all numbers out of service and Flight Hub said they didn't have a phone number, so I asked why represent a business when you have no relationship with them. This whole experience was a **** and ended up after several calls, emails and failed attempts. I got a portion of my $2582.16. flight reimbursed $1847.37. Both companies were ********** at every step of the booking process. I have all documents where different amounts were taken took from the booking and a refund, this company is ********** and charging a fee for cancelation when not clearly stated in the booking process. Definitely avoid booking travel with this company. DO NO refund of 1847.37. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY AND ********* *** AS THIS IS A COMPLETE **** they should not be allowed to do business in Canada.

I am extremely dissatisfied with the service I received regarding my recent travel booking. Initially, I was informed that I could rebook my travel to start and end before August 30, 2024. However, when I attempted to rebook, I was only given the option to complete my travel by September 1, which contradicts the initial information provided. Furthermore, I was advised that my insurance did not cover the changes I needed to make to my booking. After reviewing my insurance policy, I discovered that my situation was indeed covered, and the customer service representative had provided me with incorrect information. This ************** has caused significant inconvenience and frustration. Additionally, I found out that I could have received a refund if I had been informed to request it within 60 days after cancellation. Despite spending hours talking to customer representatives, I was never given this crucial information. This has resulted in a lost opportunity for a refund and further exacerbated my dissatisfaction. The inconsistency in the information provided and the lack of transparency have severely impacted my trust in your service. I expect accurate information and proper guidance, especially when it comes to important travel arrangements. I hope this issue is addressed promptly and that future customers are not subjected to the same ********** information and poor service.

******* into thinking they were ***** customer service, top place on ****** with a 800-***** number. They told me it would be $300 for a name change to manually update the database. My vacation would have to be "canceled and reissued". Realizing now this is a ****, they were going to cancel my reservation and rebook a new one on my behalf, not "fix a database". They target search queries, present as *****, and charge for services that are free with *****. To further confirm this ****, ***** said that no changes were made (thankfully), so work that was paid to do was never done (again, thankfully). I learned a lesson of being in a hurry.

06/06/2024	1 star	Isaac F	I booked flight with Flight Hub then, I realized that the date won't work for me. I called them the following date before 24 hours to modify the booking. Flight Hub promised to call me back to cancel the flight and told me to book another flight. I booked another flight and they refused to call me back. I kept calling, when i explained to them, their representatives would hold my calls then cut off several times. I have 2 bookings now and Flight Hub hasn't refund me for the first booking. What should I do? Over one month ahead of traveling, why didn't they refund me?

Justfly.com is a company I will never use again in my life. I booked 2 tickets for NM in October. I received a itinerary confirmation with travel dates. Then I get a phone call from their rep telling me they can't honor the departure date due to them not having any more basic seating. I don't understand how that's my fault that this company displayed ticket prices and dates for something that wasn't available to me. He proceeds to give me airports location that were 4 hours away from us and then another one that was an hour plus away from where we want to go on my requested depature date. Which wasnt accommodating to us at all. I would have to do extra traveling to get to my destination and spend more money. I was then given a day before my requested date and again. I would have to come out my pocket extra money for arriving to NM a day early. I FELT very pressured into agreeing to something because he spoke like I could NOT cancel or get a full refund and I would be losing out on hundreds. Even though what I read on the site said cancel within 24 hrs you can get a full refund. I am now on 2nd day waiting on my refund thats NOT in full. They charged me 175 for taxes and some other stuff they claim they had to charge. This company has no issue taking your money, talking you around in circles until you agree to something and then act like when you request your money back or show frustration or confusion that its your problem not theirs.

Luckily, I realized they were a separate entity and canceled the flight I was booking with them. Fought me on a refund and insulted me. ****** company.

04/06/2024	1 star	Ira L	Such a horrible service. I can’t even reach them. When I hit to call their number it leads me to an error page. It was saying that 1 checked bag is allowed. They even charged for the baggage protection. Now when I’m doing the check in, the flight company is saying only carry on luggage or enormous amount for the checked baggage. And I’m flying overseas Never again through them

Justfly is a big ****. They messed up on my return flight ,changed my date from spending 3 weeks at my destination to just spending 1 night. They refused to change my flight asking me to pay over $500 before they can do it. The agent told me it's either I pay the difference or loose my ticket

My flight was changed last minute by one of the airlines I was booked on through FlightHub. I did not receive any notice from FlightHub that my flights were changed and that my trip would be delayed by an entire day causing me to make numerous adjustments to my itinerary. I spent a whole day being told by FlightHub to call the airline and ask them to solve the issue just to be told be the airline that I had to call FlightHub to get my issue solved. The customer support representative raised his voice with me and also rudely told me to “calm down” while I was crying over the stress of all of the terrible interactions. I finally spoke to a supervisor at FlightHub who made sure I was on a flight to my final destination, which was the first actionable step taken after 5 hours on the phone. FlightHub then refused to provide any accommodation to make up for the hours of time spent on hold and the frustration I felt throughout many miscommunications. FlightHub told me that if I wanted any accommodation I would have to wait on hold with the airline for over an hour to ask them if they could do anything. I will never be booking through this service again.

Cancellation protection is absolutely useless! I paid 10% of the flight price but the conditions to use it are so restrictive that it's useless. Do not book any flights with this company!
